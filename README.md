# tic-tac-toe-caro-with-python-tkinter
Tic Tac Toe and Caro game with Python tkinter library.

1. This is my first time posting a project to GitHub.
2. I post this just for fun and for begin learning how to work with GitHub.
3. Run the module: Tic_Tac_Toe_mode.py to launch full project. But you can run others modules, they still can work separately.
4. This project is my very first python project, I created this at the time I had been learning Python for about 20 days.
5. The codes are very basic and the interface is all about fixed number of pixels. Sorry for my lacking of experience in coding.
6. I made this on Windows OS so if you run it on Linux, it will become a messy trash and will only be fixed by changing it's position/height/width constants.
7. I hope that you, the one who have taken a look on this project will have some complaints or advices for me to improve my coding skill if you can.
8. Have a nice day!
